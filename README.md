LoLCraft, a League of Legends inspired Minecraft mod.

The current version of the mod has all of the swords implemented. These swords have many of their effects from League of Legends, such as lifestealing effects, invisiblity on mob kills, and bouns effects while holding the weapon.

I plan to add custom textures, as well as axes, bows, and other types of weapons, in the near future.
I also plan to add weapon descriptions, detailing a weapon's effect in game.
